## Reference

Your HTML should have the following structure:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
   </head>
   <body>
      ...
   </body>
</html>
```

Where style.css is the name of your css file.

We will be using the **Poppins** font for this exercise.
Go to google fonts and look for it, follow the instructions.
You will have to add a link tag in the head of your HTML file.
