## Description

Create an HTML file so it matches the gif provided:

![goal](goal.gif)

## Submission

It will automatically be submitted the next time you push.

## Reference

Don't worry about styling at this point, we'll have other exercises for that

Use the `<label>` tag to make the text describing inputs clickable. Put your input elements inside label elements to achieve this effect.

Use the required attribute to make the form not submittable if something is missing

```
<input type="text" required>
```

Use the `<select>` tag for the pickup list

```
<select name="select_name">
    <option value="" selected="selected">Select One</option>
    <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
    </select>
</label>
```
